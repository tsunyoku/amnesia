# amnesia
A backend server for osu!lazer in modern Python

# Installation

amnesia is written with the entire focus on being simple to run, and isolated. To run amnesia, you will need to install docker and docker-compose. Once these are installed, you can run amnesia with the command `make run`. Note you will need to build amnesia's image first, aswell as any time a modification is made (by you or us), with the command `make build`.

Yes, you can run amnesia without docker, but it will require manual setup which will not be covered here.
